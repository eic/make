# Makefile support for the EIC software stack

The ubiquitous way of installing software in Linux is using Makefiles. This repository contains Makefile support for the EIC software stack developed by the ATHENA collaboration.

## Quickstart

Start by clone this git repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/eic/make
```

After checking out the repository, simply use the following commands.
```sh
make
make install
```

After these simple steps you will have a fully operational EIC software environment (some compilation may be required).
